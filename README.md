# Dynamic Pricing Simulation

This project simulates dynamic pricing scenarios based on fluctuating exchange rates and cost-pricing margin ratios.

## Overview

The simulation allows users to input various parameters and observe the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on selling prices and cost-pricing margin ratios over a specified number of iterations.

## Features

- **Input Parameters**: Users can input the cost per unit, initial exchange rate, selling price, cost-pricing margin ratio, exchange rate fluctuation, and the number of iterations for the simulation.
- **Real-time Results**: Simulation results are displayed in real-time, showing the exchange rate, new selling price, and new cost-pricing margin ratio for each iteration.
- **Dynamic Exchange Rate**: The exchange rate fluctuates randomly within the specified range for each iteration.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Users can adjust input parameters using input fields and observe the immediate impact on simulation results.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the simulation interface.
- **CSS**: Stylesheet language for styling the simulation interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive design and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for implementing simulation logic and dynamic behavior.
- **jQuery**: JavaScript library for simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-pricing-simulation.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Adjust the input parameters using the provided form fields.

4. Observe the simulation results updating in real-time as you make changes to the input parameters.

## How it Works

The simulation algorithm calculates new selling prices and cost-pricing margin ratios for each iteration based on the fluctuating exchange rate. These values are displayed in a tabular format, allowing users to analyze the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on pricing decisions.
